This dissertation is the result of my own work and contains nothing but my personal work  as part of the HERGE team, except where specified in the text and in \nameref{Acknowledgements}. It is to be presented before both \ingles{Universidad Politecnica de Valencia}'s and \ingles{Ecole Centrale Marseille}'s juries, respectively as Master's thesis and \ingles{Travail Fin d'Etudes} of the double degree there pursued, while nevertheless ensuring RTE confidentiality requirements are respected.

I hereby declare that except where specific reference is made to the work of others, the contents of this dissertation are original and have not been submitted in whole or in part for consideration for any other degree of qualification in this, or any other university, but those above referred.
This dissertation contains fewer than 65.000 words including appendices, bibliography, footnotes, tables and equations and has fewer than 150 figures.
